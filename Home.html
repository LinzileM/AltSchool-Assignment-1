      <h2>Biography</h2>

        My passion for design led me to embark on a thrilling journey into frontend engineering with AltSchool Africa. Why? Because I believe that the world of design is where my imagination will truly thrive.  Yes, I am treading on unfamiliar grounds and its very intimidating, but each line of code I write feels like putting together a puzzle, and I canâ€™t get enough of it.Although I might be an introvert at heart, my love for designing speaks volumes. I believe that frontend engineering will be the perfect outlet for my creativity, because good design is just as much about connecting with people as it is about aesthetics.
        So, here I am at AltSchool Africa blending my skills in marketing with design to create experiences that not only look good but also resonate with people.
